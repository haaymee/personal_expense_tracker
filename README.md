## UI Design

In addition to development and implementation, I am also designing the UI through Penpot (an open source alternative to Figma) which you can see in the following link

[UI Wireframe Link](https://design.penpot.app/#/view?file-id=458ded29-7ef8-80f7-8006-f9e4ebf06a43&page-id=458ded29-7ef8-80f7-8006-f9e4ebf06a44&section=interactions&index=0&share-id=794377fd-803b-81c8-8006-fc8a0e5df8a1 "UI Wireframe Link")

I am continuously iterating over the design and flow, making sure that each widget element is meaningful and functional.
